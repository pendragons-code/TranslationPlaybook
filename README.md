# What
This is a simple translation app with a terrible front end. I made this project out of boredom, but also because the translo api does not seem to exist anymore.

# Before you begin
This project requires an api key, and I actually made it so that it uses 4, the actual project had more api keys lent by friends since testing took up many of the request limits really quick.     
This uses the google translate api, which I got through Rapid API. The free tier only allows a limited number of calls per month and limited calls per second.

# Let's get it rolling!
